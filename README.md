# Layoffs (Despidos)


We received a database of employees from a company.
Given the information we have, we aim to predict layoffs of these employees.

To achieve this, we will:

  1.  Extract the database
  2.  Clean the data
  3.  Analyze the data
  4.  Create a prediction system (in our case, using Decision Trees)
  5.  Obtain results on the layoff rate and characteristics of laid-off employees
  6.  Create a Tableau dashboard that reflects these issues and calculates the potential savings or losses for the company.

## Tools and Technologies
    â€¢ CSV dataset.
    â€¢ Jupyter Notebook (to analyse our data).
    â€¢ Excel dataset (once we finished analysing).
    â€¢ Tableau visualization tool.
    â€¢ Machine Learning Decision Tree model for prediction.
